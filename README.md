MODULE 14 ANALYSIS
BIKE SHARING MODULE OVERVIEW
On today’s Project we are analyzing Citibike trip Data to compare trends and other metrics. 
These projections can also be used to assess the risk of starting a bike sharing company in another area or future regions. 
RESULTS. (PER Visualization)
FROM MODULE:
Per the “Starting locations” Visualization, city parks are hot spots for the bikes. To start city parks would be great spots to set up bikes.
Per the “Subscriber” Visualization, riders with a “subscription” make up almost 80% of riders. 
Meaning marketing to the idea of repeat customers may help start a customer base in new Cities. 
Furthermore an additional “secret to Success”  may be to offer incentive programs to subscribers.
FROM THE CHALLENGE:
Per the “Check out Times By Gender” Visualization, men make up a large number of riders. 
Meaning in new areas marketing DIRECTLY to men may be the best way to start in a new location. 
After establishing a following in a new city changing the marketing to appeal to women as well may further increase customers/riders. 
Per the “Check out times“ Visualization, Trips that are 10 minutes make up an overwhelming number of rides. This means the customers are using the bikes to get somewhere quick. Would be a good idea to make this a part of the marketing strategy. 
Per the “Trips By Gender (WEEKDAY)“ Visualization, Most trips are made by men during the regular “Monday thru Friday” time frames. More than likely To and/or From work.
Per the “Trips By Gender (Weekday Per Hour) “ Visualization, both men & women tend to use Citibike the most around 8am and 6pm. This confirms the information from previous Visualization. 
Many of the bikes are used to travel to and from work. This would be important to showcase in any kind of marketing. 
Per the “Trips by Weekday per Hour“ Visualization,  many riders use the bikes in the morning and in the evening. Again this confirms previous assessments. 
SUMMARY:
Based on the information, it is crucial that bikes are readily available at peak times 
(from 5am to 9am & from 4pm till 7pm)
Maintenance of the bikes must be done during “off peak” hours to have the best results for having bikes ready-to-go. 
Marketing for this kind of bike sharing may want to focus on the “getting you to work” aspect.
